Greetings! I'm Divyan , an aspiring beginner developer embarking on an exciting coding journey. Eager to learn and grow, I'm exploring various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. With a curious and determined mindset, I'm ready to tackle challenges, collaborate with fellow developers, and dive into the world of software development. Let's code together!

While I don't have professional working experience as a developer, I have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of programming and a growing proficiency in various languages such as Python , HTML , CSS and MySQL database.I'm excited to continue expanding my skill set and contribute to innovative projects.
